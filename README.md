## **Motivations**

I will use this project as a platform to reengange with **Web3** development. Implementing fundamental concepts of decentralized finance (DeFi) to resuming my learning experience with smart contract, DApps, and Ethereum integration tools like Ethers.js.

## **Features**

Aiming to achieve the following intial features:

1. **Create & Deploy Tokens**

   - Users can create their own cryptocurrency tokens.
   - Tokens will follow the **ERC20** standard and use **OpenZeppelin** libraries for reusable and secure development.
   - The process is intended to be simple & seamless, allowing anyone to deploy a token without blockchain knowledge.

2. **Initial Coin Offerings (ICO)**

   - Users can initiate ICOs for their custom tokens.
   - Users can participate by purchasing tokens during the ICO.

3. **Token Swapping and Liquidity Pools**

   - Users can swap between tokens.
   - The platform will support **liquidity pools**, enabling users to add liquidity.

4. **Staking**
   - Token holders can stake their tokens.
   - Stakers earn rewards based on the amount & period, incentivizing token holding.
   - The platform will distribute rewards & allow users to withdraw their staked tokens at any time (with a penalty for early withdrawals).
